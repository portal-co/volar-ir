// @reliability: normal
// @ai: assisted
//! Movfuscation pass: combine a multi-block [`BIrBlocks`] / [`IRBlocks`] into
//! a single self-looping block that dispatches via a binary-encoded PC.
//!
//! # Combined block layout
//!
//! ```text
//! params = [pc_bit_0 … pc_bit_{k-1}, state_0 … state_{w-1}]
//! ```
//! where `k = ⌈log₂(N)⌉` and `w = max(block param count)`.
//! PC bits are always `IRType::Bit`; state slots carry the types of the
//! corresponding original block params (which need not be `Bit`).
//!
//! # Dispatch
//!
//! For each original block `i`, the combined block:
//!
//! 1. Decodes `is_active_i = (pc_bits == binary(i))` via AND / NOT (always Bit).
//! 2. Re-emits block `i`'s stmts with `state_vars[0..params_i]` as params.
//! 3. Evaluates block `i`'s terminator →
//!    `(done_i, next_pc_i, next_state_i, ret_i)`.
//!
//! Because exactly one `is_active_i = 1` per execution step, outputs are
//! accumulated via `is_active * val` (scalar multiplication in the value's
//! field) and field addition — which collapses to XOR/AND for `Bit` types
//! and to proper field ops for extension-field types:
//!
//! ```text
//! done          = Σ_i  is_active_i · done_i           (GF(2) XOR/AND)
//! next_pc[j]    = Σ_i  is_active_i · next_pc_i[j]     (GF(2))
//! next_state[s] = Σ_i  is_active_i · next_state_i[s]  (field of slot s)
//! ret[m]        = Σ_i  is_active_i · ret_i[m]         (field of slot m)
//! ```
//!
//! # Terminator of the combined block
//!
//! ```text
//! JumpCond(done, Return(ret), Block(0, [next_pc…, next_state…]))
//! ```
//!
//! # Field type support (IRBlocks)
//!
//! `movfuscate_ir` accepts blocks whose params may have any scalar `IRType`
//! (`Bit`, `Galois8AES`, `Galois64`, or `Vec`).  All blocks that share a
//! state slot at position `k` must agree on its type.  The generated
//! dispatch arithmetic uses `IRStmt::Poly` with the appropriate field
//! semantics:
//!
//! - **Gate** (`is_active · val` for `is_active: Bit`, `val: T`):
//!   `Poly { {[is_active, val]: 1u8}, constant: 0 }` — scalar multiplication
//!   of a field element by a GF(2) element embedded in T.
//! - **Field add** (`a + b` for `a, b: T`):
//!   `Poly { {[a]: 1u8, [b]: 1u8}, constant: 0 }` — field addition.
//! - **Typed select** (`select(bit, a: T, b: T) = bit·(a+b) + b`): three
//!   `Poly` stmts.

/// active again, at which point every predecessor freshly rewrites it from
/// scratch. Two *different* blocks' params at the same `(position, type)`
